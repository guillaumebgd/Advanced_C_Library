## Goal of the Project

It has for main goal to maintain my C Programming abilities up-to-date, however, as a public project, it could show how far you can have fun with basic functions in C
whether in optimization or in generalization.

## Table of Contents:

To come in the near future:

<code>int my_printf(const char *input, ...);</code>

char *get_next_line(const int fd);
