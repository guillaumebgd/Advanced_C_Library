# Advanced C Library

## Description

A single-handled C library that bases itself on C standard library, but given more tools and error handlers.<br>
The Library will see new features throughout the project and not just upgrades.

## Goal of the Project

It has for main goal to maintain my C Programming abilities up-to-date, however, as a public project, it could show people how far you can have fun with C whether in optimization or in generalization.

## Usage of the Library

Some commentaries about those functions are to be found in header files of this project.<br>
A wiki page for usable content of the library is available [here](https://github.com/guillaumebgd/Advanced_C_Library/wiki/Advanced-C-Library:-Functions)!
